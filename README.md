# AWS OpstWorks PHP set Environment variables. 

# Summary

Currently it is not possible to setup Environment Variables for PHP stacks in 
 Amazon Web Services OpsWorks. This simple Chef recipe to add environment variables 
 to the .htaccess file by using a template.  The .htaccess file is used for the 
 framework [FuelPHP](http://fuelphp.com) but it can be used for other frameworks
 and php projects. Just change the destination. 

#Requirements
* Apache2
* mod_env must be enabled. 

# Version
0.1.0

# Credits
Some parts of this code where taken from the [ace-cookbooks opsworks_app_environment](https://github.com/ace-cookbooks/opsworks_app_environment). Also see [this](https://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?threadID=118107).

# Installation
- In your OpsWorks stack settings enable **"Use custom Chef Cookbooks"**
- Select **"Repository type"** = Git (or any repository you choose to use)
- **"Repository URL"** use git@github.com:onema/chef-cookbooks.git or your Fork Url.
- Set the SSH key if you have one, if not this can be left blank as long as the repo is public. 
- Use the following format for the Custom Chef JSON:

```
{
    "custom_env": {
        "staging_site": {
            "values" : [ 
                "FUEL_ENV staging", 
                "CACHE_TIME 3600", 
                "SOME_API_KEY BlahBlah", 
                "ANOTHER_API_KEY helloWorld!" 
            ] 
        },
        "production_site": {
            "values" : [ 
                "FUEL_ENV production", 
                "CACHE_TIME 1234", 
                "SOME_API_KEY nahnah", 
                "ANOTHER_API_KEY hello-monkey!" 
            ] 
        }
    }
}
```

The name custom_env is required. The values staging_site and production_site must match your application name.

In the array of values for each application you can put any number of environment variables. The format is

"KEY value"

in the example above the production site $_SERVER array would look like this:

```php
Array
(
//... 
    [ANOTHER_API_KEY] => hello-monkey!
    [FUEL_ENV] => production
    [GA_API_CACHE_TIME] => 1234
    [SOME_API_KEY] => nahnah
//... 
)
```

**NOTE: THE RECIPE WILL NOT WORK IF YOUR APPLICATION NAME HAS SPACES OR DASHES "-" BETWEEN WORDS. Use underscores "_" to separate words to avoid problems**

- Finally go to **"Layer"** and edit the **"PHP App Server"**
- Under **"Custom Chef recipes"** -> **"Deploy"** add 

``` phpenv::configure ```

That's it! next time you deploy your application you will have a custom .htaccess file that contains all the environment variables. 

The .htaccess generated by this recipe will look like this:

```
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
  RewriteEngine on 
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f 
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d 
  RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php/$1 [L] 
  
  <IfModule mod_env.c> 
    # Environment Variables for application git_myphp 
    SetEnv ANOTHER_API_KEY hello-monkey! 
    SetEnv FUEL_ENV production 
    SetEnv GA_API_CACHE_TIME 1234 
    SetEnv SOME_API_KEY nahnah 
  </IfModule> 
</IfModule>
```
